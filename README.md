# AI-Based IT Training System
**Associated with:** Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology
**Project Duration:** October 2023 – February 2024

# Overview
This AI-based IT Training System is a self-paced learning platform designed to cater to individual learning preferences. It provides an adaptive and engaging learning experience through the use of advanced AI models (Gemini and AI21 Studio) fine-tuned for prompt engineering. Learners receive personalized content, quizzes, coding exercises, and real-time feedback based on their progress.

The project is built using Node.js, React.js, Python, and MongoDB (NoSQL database) and follows a monolithic architecture for easier maintenance and deployment.

# Features
1. **Personalized Learning Path**
Each user’s learning journey is customized based on their performance and progress.
The system adapts to the individual’s learning style and mistakes by providing alternative solutions, explanations, and new exercises.
Dynamic Content Update: Code exercises and quizzes update based on user performance, ensuring a smooth learning curve.
2. **Custom Content Generation**
Users can input topics, upload videos or PDFs, or simply name a concept, and the system generates a tailored study guide.
Recommended learning materials include videos, quizzes, chat assistance, and coding exercises, aligning with user-defined content.
3. **Real-Time Feedback & Improvement Suggestions**
The online code editor provides instant suggestions for code improvement and detailed explanations of the user's current code.
Feedback on mistakes is used to generate the next set of exercises, promoting continuous improvement.
4. **AI-Driven Quizzes and Coding Exercises**
Quizzes and programming exercises are dynamically generated using fine-tuned AI models (Gemini, AI21 Studio).
The AI evaluates the user’s learning patterns and adapts the content accordingly.
5. **Interactive Learning Tools**
Chatbot Assistant: A chatbot, powered by AI, helps users by answering their queries and providing guidance throughout the learning process.
Practice Codes: Users are provided with practical coding exercises tailored to their progress and mistakes.
Video Recommendations: Curated video tutorials based on user activity to enhance understanding of complex topics.
6.**Non-Relational Database** (MongoDB) for Scalability
MongoDB manages user progress, learning content, quizzes, and coding exercises, providing efficient data retrieval and management.
Allows for easy scalability and adaptability of the system to accommodate large numbers of users.
**Technologies Used**
**Frontend:**

**React.js:** For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
**Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.

**Backend:**
**Node.js:** For server-side operations and API handling.
**Express.js:** Framework used for creating API endpoints and handling requests.

**AI Models:**
Gemini and AI21 Studio models were used to drive personalized content generation and real-time code suggestions.
Prompt Engineering: Fine-tuned large language models for effective responses and content generation.

**Database:**
MongoDB (Non-relational): For managing and storing data such as user profiles, learning progress, and content.

**Programming Languages:**
JavaScript (Node.js, React.js)
Python (for integrating AI models)

**Prerequisites:**
Node.js (v14.x or higher)
MongoDB (Atlas or Local setup)
Python (for AI model integration)
AI API Keys (For Gemini and AI21 Studio)

**Possible Future Improvements**
**Mobile App Version:** A mobile-friendly version of the platform for on-the-go learning.
**Gamification:** Adding achievement badges and leaderboards to increase user engagement.
**Advanced Analytics:** Enhanced learning analytics and reports for users to track progress in more detail.
**Multi-language Support:** Expanding the platform to support multiple languages for a broader audience.
**Collaborative Learning:** Enable users to collaborate in teams for group-based learning experiences.
